   File Name:          number-001
   Corresponds To:     15.7.4.2-2-n.js
   ECMA Section:       15.7.4.2.2 Number.prototype.toString()
   Description:
   If the radix is the number 10 or not supplied, then this number value is
   given as an argument to the ToString operator; the resulting string value
   is returned.

   If the radix is supplied and is an integer from 2 to 36, but not 10, the
   result is a string, the choice of which is implementation dependent.

   The toString function is not generic; it generates a runtime error if its
   this value is not a Number object. Therefore it cannot be transferred to
   other kinds of objects for use as a method.
